# Luke Shivers' Portfolio

## Software Engineer, Web Developer, UI/UX Designer
 
The goal of this portfolio website is to showcase my skills and qualifications
in an elegant single-page format. A blue monochromic, paper-like style was used
in conjunction with both scroll-based and Lottie animations. All illustrations 
and animations were made in Adobe Illustrtor and After Effects. As a test to myself 
and my abilities, this portfolio was built with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript ONLY. 
No frameworks or libraries were used! Visit the site:
